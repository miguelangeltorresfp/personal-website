Remove Markdown formatting with [**remark**][remark].  This essentially removes
everything but paragraphs and text nodes.

> This is one of the first remark plugins, before prefixing with
> `remark-` got cool.

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install strip-markdown
```

## Usage

```javascript
var remark = require('remark')
var strip = require('strip-markdown')

remark()
  .use(strip)
  .process('Some _emphasis_, **importance**, and `code`.', function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Yields:

```text
Some emphasis, importance, and code.
```

## API

### `remark().use(strip)`

Modifies **remark** to expose plain-text.

*   Removes `html`, `code`, `horizontalRule`, `table`, `yaml`, `toml`, and their
    content
*   Render everything else as simple paragraphs without formatting
*   Uses `alt` text for images
